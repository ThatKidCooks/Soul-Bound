/**
 * AquaticListener manages the "Aquatic Heart" achievement system.
 * 
 * The Aquatic Heart is awarded to the first player who swims 5,000 blocks (500,000 cm).
 * This is a statistic-based heart that uses Minecraft's built-in SWIM_ONE_CM statistic
 * to track player swimming distance across all sessions.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Uses Bukkit's persistent statistic system for accurate tracking
 * - Periodically checked by the Caller system (not event-based)
 * - Awards the Aquatic Heart to the first player reaching the swimming milestone
 * - Provides progress feedback through swimming distance queries
 * - Persists award status across server restarts
 * - Ensures only one player can receive the heart
 * 
 * Note: This is a statistic-based heart, meaning it's checked periodically by the
 * Caller system rather than responding to specific events.
 * 
 * @see site.thatkid.soulBound.managers.hearts.statistic.Caller
