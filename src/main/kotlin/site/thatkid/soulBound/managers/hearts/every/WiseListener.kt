/**
 * WiseListener manages the "Wise Heart" achievement system.
 * 
 * The Wise Heart is awarded to the first player who successfully brews all possible potion effects.
 * This listener tracks player brewing activities and maintains a record of which potion effects
 * each player has successfully brewed.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Tracks brewing stand interactions to identify the brewer
 * - Records all unique potion effects brewed by each player
 * - Awards the Wise Heart when a player has brewed all possible effects
 * - Persists data to JSON file for server restarts
 * - Ensures only one player can receive the heart (first-come-first-served)
 * 
 * @param plugin The JavaPlugin instance for file operations and logging
