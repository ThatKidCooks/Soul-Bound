/**
 * WiseListener manages the "Wise Heart" achievement system.
 * 
 * The Wise Heart is a rare heart awarded to the first player who brews all unique potion effects.
 * This is one of the most complex heart systems as it must track potion brewing across multiple
 * events and handle the intricate relationship between brewing stands, players, and potion types.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Tracks inventory clicks to associate players with brewing stands
 * - Monitors brew events to detect when potions are successfully created
 * - Maintains a registry of all unique potion effects each player has brewed
 * - Awards the Wise Heart when a player has brewed all possible potion effects
 * - Handles serialization complexities with PotionEffectType conversion
 * - Persists data across server restarts
 * - Ensures only one player can receive the heart
 * 
 * Complex Event Handling:
 * Since brewing is a multi-step process, this listener must:
 * 1. Track which player last interacted with each brewing stand (InventoryClickEvent)
 * 2. When brewing completes (BrewEvent), associate the brewed potions with that player
 * 3. Extract potion effect types from the resulting items and add to player's collection
 * 4. Check if the player has now brewed all possible effects and award the heart
 * 
 * Serialization Logic:
 * PotionEffectType cannot be directly serialized to JSON, so this system:
 * - Converts PotionEffectType to String keys for storage
 * - Converts String keys back to PotionEffectType on load
 * - Handles cases where effect types may have changed between server versions
 * 
 * @param plugin The JavaPlugin instance for file operations and logging
