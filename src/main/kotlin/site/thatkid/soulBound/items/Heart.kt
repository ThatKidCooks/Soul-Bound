/**
 * Abstract base class for all SoulBound hearts.
 * 
 * Hearts are special items that provide both passive and active abilities to players.
 * Each heart type has unique requirements to obtain and specific effects when held.
 * Only one of each heart type can exist on the server at any time.
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * - **Constant Effect**: Passive ability applied continuously while holding the heart
 * - **Special Effect**: Active ability triggered by the player with a cooldown
 * - **Trust System**: Players can trust others to prevent heart effects from harming them
 * - **Progress Tracking**: Each heart has specific quest requirements to obtain
 * 
 * @see site.thatkid.soulBound.items.hearts for implementations of specific heart types
